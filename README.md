ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kurt!<br>
Iâ€™m a web developer located In Montreal, Quebec. I'm fascinated with the possibilities of storytelling using web technologies. Previously, I studied filmmaking, worked briefly on independent films as both a sound and lighting technician. Now I'm fully commited to growing as a front-end developer and on the look out for oppertunities!
